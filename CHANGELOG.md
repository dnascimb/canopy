## 1.1.0 — 2026-09-07

**Spaces & planner**
- Spaces have a stage (clone / vegetative / flowering), dimensions and a user-set maximum.
- Strains carry a size class (small / medium / large). Per-plant footprints by stage × size
  drive fit estimates; defaults are tunable with `CANOPY_FOOTPRINT_*`.
- Plants have a location (explicit or inferred from status / group). Bulk "move to" on a
  group and single "move to" on a plant, which also aligns status with the destination.
- Spaces page is now a planner: occupancy per space, room for N more of each size, season
  load chart for flower spaces, a "coming up" table of what each waiting group needs, and
  the spacing rules in effect.
- Capacity conflicts use area when dimensions are known, only from today forward; a
  warning is raised when any space is over capacity today.
- New `clone` plant status; demo season includes a clone shelf, veg tent and 5×10 flower tent.

**Journal**
- Quick log with task checkboxes on the dashboard and every group page; title is derived
  from ticked tasks when left blank. Task chips on entries; filter by task.
- "Last watered / fed / …" summary on each group.

**Reports** (new page)
- Dry yield and grams-per-plant per strain, survival per strain, kill reasons, yield per
  group, flower-space load over the season. Server-rendered SVG, prints cleanly.

**API**
- `GET /api/v1/spaces`, `GET /api/v1/spaces/<id>/load`; plants include `location`;
  strains include `size`; conflicts include occupancy warnings.

**Backup schema** stays at version 1 with additive fields (`stage`, `width_ft`,
`length_ft`, `size`, `space_id`, `tasks`); 1.0 backups restore unchanged.

## 1.0.0 — 2026-09-07
